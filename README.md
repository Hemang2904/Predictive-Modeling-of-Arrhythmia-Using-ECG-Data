## Introduction

This project focuses on the classification of arrhythmias using machine learning techniques. The dataset utilised is sourced from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, accessible [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Arrhythmia).

### Dataset Overview
- **Total Samples**: 452
  - **Normal Samples**: 245
  - **Arrhythmia Samples**: 207 (across 12 different types)
- **Features**: 279
  - Includes patient demographics (age, sex, weight, height) and various ECG measurements.

### Project Objective
The primary goal is to predict whether an individual is suffering from an arrhythmia and, if so, to classify the specific type of arrhythmia into one of the 12 categories.

## Algorithms Used

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**
2. **Logistic Regression**
3. **Decision Tree Classifier**
4. **Linear Support Vector Classifier (Linear SVC)**
5. **Kernelized Support Vector Classifier (Kernelized SVC)**
6. **Random Forest Classifier**
7. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**

## Conclusion

The application of PCA significantly improved the performance of the models. This improvement can be attributed to several factors:
- **Dimensionality Reduction**: PCA reduces the number of features by transforming the data into components that capture the most variance.
- **Non-collinearity**: The components generated by PCA are uncorrelated, addressing multicollinearity issues.
- **Efficiency**: PCA reduces the computational complexity, leading to faster model training and prediction times.

The best performing model in terms of recall score was the **Kernelized SVM with PCA**, achieving an accuracy of 80.21%.

## Future Work

- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Further optimization of model parameters could yield better performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Additional domain-specific features could be engineered to improve classification accuracy.
- **Ensemble Methods**: Combining multiple models might enhance predictive performance.
